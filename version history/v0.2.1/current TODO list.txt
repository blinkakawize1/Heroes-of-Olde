#1 build dialogue tree class/function
#2 build explore system
(this system will be a randomizer that draws from possible encounters in each area,
like a slot machine sort of. it checks for treasure encounter, enemy encounter, npc encounter, harvest opportunity, location discovery, or a nothing result.

#3 combat system
(turn based which when you have commited your action, it will display what your action was, and what the enemy's action was)

(there are two kinds of enemy encounter. one which is obligatory, and one which is optional, aka choosing to fight or not. both of these occur randomly.)

and what the enemy's action was in response
#4 enemy class
#5 more objekts/weapons/items
