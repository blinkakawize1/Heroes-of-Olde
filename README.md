Hello all and thank you for having a look at my game.

This text based RPG is being written in python using the python IDLE.

To run the program as it is, download the folder and then run main.py.

To give you a breakdown of the modules, currently there is main.py, functions.py, and data.py. You can pretty much ignore everything else.

If you have any specific questions about which functions do what, please send them to me.
